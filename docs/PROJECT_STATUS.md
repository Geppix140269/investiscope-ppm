## 💡 Key Innovation: The Journey-Based Approach

### Before (Property Management Focus):
- Assumed users already owned property
- Limited market (only owners)
- Short customer lifetime (6-12 months)
- Single revenue stream

### After (Full Journey Platform):
- Guides from interest → search → purchase → ownership
- Larger market (dreamers + buyers + owners)
- Longer lifetime (2-3 years)
- Multiple revenue streams (subscriptions + professionals + services)

---

## 🚀 What Makes This Special

### 1. **Progressive Value Unlock**
- Free users see the journey but have limited access
- Each subscription tier unlocks more of the journey
- Natural progression from dreamer to buyer to owner

### 2. **Contextual Monetization**
- Features are gated based on where users are in their journey
- Upgrade prompts appear when users need the feature
- Clear value proposition at each tier

### 3. **Dual-Mode Platform**
- Same codebase serves both buyers and owners
- Users naturally progress from one to the other
- No wasted development effort

---

## 📝 Database Changes Needed

```sql
-- Add to properties table
ALTER TABLE properties 
ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'owned',
ADD COLUMN listing_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN listing_price DECIMAL,
ADD COLUMN viewing_date TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN agent_name VARCHAR(255),
