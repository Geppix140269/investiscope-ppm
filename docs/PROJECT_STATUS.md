# Project Update - July 12, 2025 (Day 3, Session 3)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION FOR ALL FUTURE SESSIONS ⚠️
**ALWAYS PUT THE FULL FILE PATH AT THE TOP OF EVERY CODE FILE!**

Example:
```typescript
// File: app/dashboard/page.tsx
```

This is CRITICAL because the repository has 1000s of files and searching for the correct location is time-consuming.

-- Add to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN subscription_tier VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'free',

```
