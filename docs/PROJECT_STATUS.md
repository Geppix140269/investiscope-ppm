## ⚡ Development Workflow

### IMPORTANT: Live Development Approach
- **NO LOCAL TESTING** - All development is done directly on GitHub
- **Workflow**:
  1. ✏️ Edit files directly on GitHub (web interface)
  2. 📤 Commit changes directly to main branch
  3. 🚀 Netlify auto-deploys on every commit
  4. 🌐 Test changes on live Netlify URL
- **Benefits**:
  - No local environment setup needed
  - Immediate deployment feedback
  - Simplified workflow
  - Real-world testing environment
- **Considerations**:
  - Each commit triggers a build
  - Errors are visible in production immediately
  - Use clear commit messages for debugging

### 📋 Code Update Policy
- **NO LINE-BY-LINE CHANGES** - To avoid syntax errors and save mental energy
- **Always provide COMPLETE FILES** for copy/paste replacement
- **Workflow for updates**:
  1. 🤖 AI provides the entire updated file
  2. 📄 Developer copies the complete file content
  3. 📝 Developer replaces entire file content in GitHub
  4. ✅ Commit and auto-deploy
- **Benefits**:
  - Zero syntax errors from partial edits
  - Faster implementation
  - Less cognitive load
  - Consistent code formatting

### Database Migrations
- All tables use JSONB for flexible data storage
- RLS (Row Level Security) is enabled on all tables
- Policies ensure users only see their own data

### Next Steps for New Sessions
When starting a new chat session, simply mention:
1. "Continue InvestiScope PPM development"
2. "Check PROJECT_STATUS.md for current state"
3. Any specific feature you want to work on

## 🐛 Known Issues
- None currently

## 📊 Performance Considerations
- Using Supabase free tier (500MB limit)
- Optimizing with JSONB columns
- Planning Cloudinary integration for images
