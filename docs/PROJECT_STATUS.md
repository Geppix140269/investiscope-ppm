## ⚡ Development Workflow

### IMPORTANT: Live Development Approach
- **NO LOCAL TESTING** - All development is done directly on GitHub
- **Workflow**:
  1. ✏️ Edit files directly on GitHub (web interface)
  2. 📤 Commit changes directly to main branch
  3. 🚀 Netlify auto-deploys on every commit
  4. 🌐 Test changes on live Netlify URL
- **Benefits**:
  - No local environment setup needed
  - Immediate deployment feedback
  - Real-world testing environment
- **Current Status**: ⚠️ Builds failing due to naming issues above

### 📋 Code Update Policy
- **NO LINE-BY-LINE CHANGES** - To avoid syntax errors
- **Always provide COMPLETE FILES** for copy/paste replacement
- **Benefits**:
  - Zero syntax errors from partial edits
  - Faster implementation
  - Consistent code formatting
