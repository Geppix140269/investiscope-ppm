  3. 🚀 Netlify auto-deploys on every commit
  4. 🌐 Test changes on live Netlify URL
- **Benefits**:
  - No local environment setup needed
  - Immediate deployment feedback
  - Simplified workflow
  - Real-world testing environment

### 📋 Code Update Policy
- **NO LINE-BY-LINE CHANGES** - To avoid syntax errors
- **Always provide COMPLETE FILES** for copy/paste replacement
- **Always specify EXACT FILE PATHS** when creating/updating files
- **Workflow for updates**:
  1. 🤖 AI provides the entire updated file
  2. 📄 Developer copies the complete file content
  3. 📝 Developer replaces entire file content in GitHub
  4. ✅ Commit and auto-deploy
