# InvestiScope PPM - Session Summary for Next Chat

## GitHub Repository
**Repo:** https://github.com/Geppix140269/investiscope-ppm

## Current Date
July 11, 2025

## Project Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **Authentication** - Login/Register/Logout functional
2. **Basic Navigation** - Simplified to Dashboard & Properties only
3. **Dashboard** - Shows welcome message, stats, and recent properties
4. **Properties CRUD** - Can create, read, update, delete properties
5. **Deployment** - Live on Netlify at investiscope.net

### ‚ùå Current Issues:
1. **Document Upload** - Fails with "new row violates row-level security policy"
   - RLS policies were added but still not working
   - Need to check storage bucket policies
   - Need to verify table structure matches code
2. **Property Detail Page** - Tabs not visible/rendering properly
3. **Projects Module** - Created but not linked in navigation
4. **Team/Documents Pages** - Created but not integrated

### üìÅ File Structure:
- Navigation: `app/components/Navigation.tsx`
- Dashboard: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Properties: `app/properties/` (list, new, [id], [id]/edit)
- Projects: `app/projects/` (created but not active)
- Documents: `app/documents/page.tsx` (created but not linked)
- Team: `app/team/page.tsx` (created but not linked)
- Layout: `app/layout.tsx` (uses `./global.css` not `globals.css`)

### üîß Tech Stack:
- Next.js 14.1.0
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage)
- Deployed on Netlify

### üìä Database Tables:
- profiles
- properties
- projects
- tasks
- documents (RLS issue here)
- team_members

## Next Steps Priority:

1. **Fix Document Upload**
   - Debug RLS policies
   - Check storage bucket configuration
   - Verify `uploaded_by` column exists
   - Test with RLS temporarily disabled

2. **Fix Property Detail Tabs**
   - Tabs should show: Overview, Projects, Documents
   - Document upload component exists but not rendering

3. **Enable Projects Module**
   - Add to navigation
   - Test CRUD operations

## Development Approach:
- **NO LOCAL TESTING** - All done on GitHub
- **Complete file replacements** - No line-by-line edits
- **Live on Netlify** - Auto-deploys on commit

# Prompt for Next Chat:

"I'm continuing work on InvestiScope PPM (https://github.com/Geppix140269/investiscope-ppm). 

Current issue: Document upload fails with 'new row violates row-level security policy' error despite adding RLS policies. The property detail page exists but tabs (Overview, Projects, Documents) aren't visible. 

We're on July 11, 2025. The app is deployed on Netlify at investiscope.net. We use Supabase for backend.

Please help me:
1. Fix the document upload RLS issue
2. Make the property detail tabs visible
3. Then enable the Projects module

I need complete file replacements, not line-by-line changes. Check the session summary in the docs folder for full context."
