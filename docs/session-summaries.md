# Prompt for Next Chat:

"I'm continuing work on InvestiScope PPM (https://github.com/Geppix140269/investiscope-ppm). 

Current issue: Document upload fails with 'new row violates row-level security policy' error despite adding RLS policies. The property detail page exists but tabs (Overview, Projects, Documents) aren't visible. 

We're on July 11, 2025. The app is deployed on Netlify at investiscope.net. We use Supabase for backend.

Please help me:
1. Fix the document upload RLS issue
2. Make the property detail tabs visible
3. Then enable the Projects module

I need complete file replacements, not line-by-line changes. Check the session summary in the docs folder for full context."
